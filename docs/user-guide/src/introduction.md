# Metal³

Metal³ project (pronounced: Metal Kubed) exists to provide components
that allow you to do bare metal host management for Kubernetes. Metal³
works as a Kubernetes application, meaning it runs on Kubernetes and is
managed through Kubernetes interfaces.

Metal³ is one of the providers for the Kubernetes sub-project [Cluster
API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) and is focused on
providing Kubernetes native APIs to manage Kubernetes clusters in a bare
metal environment.
